In 5 years, I want to be programming as a software engineer. I want to be part of a team; I want to be grappling with knotty questions; I want to know the relevance of my work in the context of driving social change (not just "progress" along an unquestioned trajectory); I want to feel intellectually stimulated on a daily basis; and I want to be fully immersed in something that demands emotional and mental investment.

I want to immerse myself, maybe see how to blend my interest in education with coding and think about teaching / math / coding as a thing and way forward. So many people are turned off by math, and maybe this is a way to reach them and show them more directly the relevance in the world.
