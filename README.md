Ada application Section II

_Question 1_  
My favorite card game by far is _Set_. I’m obsessed. Senior year in college, I’d come home from a night out, crash onto my bed with the deck, and play against myself. _Super-Set_ became an addiction. To this day, a deck remains constantly in my backpack. So last Thanksgiving, when a friend of mine who was visiting told me she’d never played, I was floored. She’s a programmer (and prior teacher at Grace Hopper in New York), and I’d assumed she’d be a fellow addict. It took her no more than 10 minutes to pick up the rules and fall suspect to the contagion of my love.  Her first reaction, and one that took root in my mind far more, I imagine, than she anticipated, was one of certainty: “Clarion, you should learn to code.”

Ayana may have re-ignited my interest. But the idea of learning to code had been lying low in my mind for a time already. Always, I’ve considered myself a “math person” (though I hate that that is even an acceptable categorization). And I have spent the last four years as a high school math teacher. It’s the beauty, the elegance, and the creativity of math that enthralls me. G.H. Hardy’s description rings most true (and I aspire to its truth): “A mathematician, like a painter or poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.” Playing with patterns, letting my imagination run free within a set of known boundaries, exploring the unavoidable results of these patterns and where they lead -- that, to me, is a joyful experiment. The freedom appeals to me: Perhaps driven by an abstract question or ultimate goal, the process itself remains open-ended, the only limitations being my ability (or willingness) to imagine different paths through some minimal scaffolding. Where to climb next? What tool do I need to grab from my toolbox? My notion of intellectual challenge and stimulation is finding simplicity amidst seeming chaos, tinkering and streamlining, asking simple and elegant questions and crafting the most elegant, incisive, and beautiful explanations. 

From what I hear, programming is a natural extension of this type of thinking. There’s a strict logic providing a framework, a structure. A language dictates certain rules of syntax and communication. But beyond that, it’s a wide open puzzle. I imagine a playground, a jungle-gym, one that I can play in as I wish. Yes, certain conventions and guidelines exist; but nothing stops me from determining a new way across the monkey-bars. The "point," if there must be one, is the process. Achieving some product by brute force doesn't count. It’s about the how : How to nimbly navigate from point A to point B, how to do it with elegance and efficiency. I want to pierce through ambiguity with decisiveness. I want to learn to ask a machine to run extremely complex algorithms with simplicity. I want to revel in those clean-cut solutions that emerge from the fog of uncertainty, of experimentation, of seemingly-blind blundering that finally comes to fruition. 

I also think code is the language of the future. I’d be lying if I pretended that the current, seemingly-widespread opportunities in software engineering and programming weren't a pull. Learning to code seems a necessary step in my path forward; it seems to be a more and more critical skill in our tech-reliant world. Right now, I'm too ignorant for my own liking (or comfort). I’ve dabbled in Code Academy, and attempted to teach myself Python, Java, and Ruby with its courses. I say "attempted": I have completed those courses, and while I found myself able to do each lesson relatively easily, I don't feel I have any real idea of how to apply those skills in a broader context. And without the practice of actually solving a problem or building a program, I feel I haven't actually gained much ground.  

I suppose that since I'm a teacher, it's unsurprising that I'm a firm believer in the power of learning from another breathing person. The kind of intensive, highly relational, and interpersonal education that Ada provides strikes a deep chord in me. It seems only right that an emphasis on community offers a foundation for y'all. From what I know, programming is a realm in which independence and creativity must blend seamlessly with collaboration. A recognition of individual voice coexists with an emphasis on collective effort. I want to find a place where a feeling of support and camaraderie is what makes it okay for me to take that occassional, spontaneous, self-believing plunge, the leap of faith required to cross the chasm of uncertainty and find truth.


_Question 2_  
In 5 years, I want to be programming as a software engineer -- and I want to be doing that in a context of education, the law and/or social justice work. I want to be part of a team; I want to be grappling with knotty questions; I want to know the relevance of my work in the context of driving social change (not just "social progress" along an unquestioned trajectory); I want to feel intellectually stimulated on a daily basis; and I want to be fully immersed in something that demands emotional and mental investment.

Those are my big-picture, kinda lofty goals. More specifically, I'd ideally have found a way (or be on my way) to combining tech and engineering with my passion for social justice through teaching or legal reform. Blending my interests in education and coding might most obviously lead me to think about teaching math through coding. So many people are turned off by math, and maybe this is a way to reach them or show them more directly the relevance in the world. But beyond that: I want to empower students, youth, and underrepresented populations to speak with conviction, and I want to provide them with the relevant tools for letting themselves be heard. Programming as a tool in the service of that empowerment seems a powerful potential. Any work that I could do as part of a non-profit or organization involved in that mission would be, in my mind, the most fulfilling possibility. Alternatively, I'd be thrilled to find a niche in which I could apply coding skills to forward the movement for gay rights (I use that term in the most broad sense). Right now, the need for strong advocates, allies, and legal scholars seems particularly pressing. We need peeople who are well-versed in constitutional law and equal protection; we need folks who are familiar with the legal history of individual rights; we need wielders of that knowledge to be able to make themselves heard and known and felt. If I can contribute to that effort--combining a proficiency in programming with a passion for legal protection--in order to help fight for the voiceless and earn support for their cause, I'd finally feel like I was doing something worthwhile.


_Question 3_  
So much of my work up until this point has been influenced by an undercurrent of multiculturalism. I wouldn't have anticipated it of myself when I was younger. In Lower School, I labeled myself "Asian" without a second's hesitation. Thoughtlessly, I erased my father's white half of the family until 2008, when my dad and I talked frankly about Obama. What did it mean to emphasize his blackness and ignore his biracial identity? It went unsaid that day, but I wondered what my dad felt when I acknowledged only my Asian heritage. That conversation sparked a growing interest for me, and I pursued a position as a Minority Peer Counselor Friend at college. There, I helped facilitate a freshmen orientation program that offered "an examination of the problems that divide our society" with the aim of "breaking down the barriers... [and] building understanding and community." We explored systems of oppression, their effects in our own lives, and in senior year, I led the workshop on heteronormativity and homophobia.

More recently, my years teaching in DC have been a stark reminder about the challenges involved in creating an inclusive and diverse community. The Field School prides itself on embracing all manner of students; it considers itself one of the most liberal and accepting independent school environments. And in general, I'd agree. But it's an independent school in DC, and it's the most expensive independent school in DC. The community reflects that. Attempts to diversify may help make the numbers more palatable; but day-to-day experience in the building constrasts with the data. Being here--in an extremely privileged, extremely white school-- has taught me much about the importance of naming privilege, leaning into discomfort, disturbing the silence. 

I am a young female math teacher. I am a half-Chinese math teacher. Each statement carries weight. Each statement carries assumptions. One perhaps seems more unusual, one more unsuprising.
When parents walk into my room on Back-to-School-Night, I wonder what they see first. I am young (One of them once asked me if I was a sophomore or a junior). I am a rather androgynous and masculine-leaning lesbian. 
My Chinese grandparents were forced to flee the Cultural Revolution under Mao. My white-ancestors were plantation owners in Texas.

Ada's emphasis on diversity and inclusivity is a compelling draw for me. It is, in fact, imperative. As I make my next move, I know I want to be part of a deliberate community: I want to embed myself in a rich texture of self-aware and open-minded humans. I want to hear and learn and grow and be pushed by a variety of other voices; I want to be in a place where I can openly share my own story, and bring my own authentic self to the table, knowing that those around me will do the same; I want to join my voice with a chorus of others in purposeful, unflinching conversation. Right now, merely floating along with the current of society seems a dangerous proposition, allowing us to be moved in an unsavory direction. I'm feeling the urge to stand up and speak up. The spheres of influence in today's society--whether political or commercial or informational--are largely dominated by heteronormative white men. On the Hill, in CEO offices, in many software engineering headquarters across the country, the white male perspective is the one that reigns. And while many white men are our great allies, I think it's important that their perspective does not go unchallenged. Traditionally "othered" voices need to be heard. And my hope, my driving goal, is to help such folks take their rightful place at the table.


_Question 4_  
As a student, I thrived in an environment of challenge and pressure. High expectations were set; nothing less was accepted. So I learned to relish that challenge and feed on that pressure. Others demanded excellence. I came to demand perfection from myself. And I learned and grew and learned some more. 

So when I returned to a high school setting--this time in my new role as a teacher--my impulse was to create a similar environment. I wanted to push my students and see them rise to the occasion. My teachers had asked me to struggle, to hang in there and fight through on my own. They had told me to take ownership of my learning. They hadn’t coddled. So neither did I. I pushed and I challenged. And I kept pushing, even when the kids started floundering. Good, I thought. This is the moment where learni ng occurs, where they slowly fight to find their footing again and emerge on the other side of confusion victorious. I pushed. “You can do it,” I kept saying.  “I don’t know what to do” they said. Still I kept pushing. They wanted explicit guidance and I withheld it. “Try something. Think of the most useless thing you could do, and then do anything else. At least you’ll know it’s not the worst idea to try.” Still, I was pushing.

Unsurprisingly, they shut down. In my effort to push my students to be “the best,” I actually lost touch with their humanity, their fear and anxiety and worry about making mistakes. I lost track of their age and uncertainty, their fragility. Mitchell could be pushed, I thought. He was definitely capable of grappling with the tough questions, the abstractions and their proofs. I pushed him hard and fast, demanded too much too soon, And he balked. In his eyes, I was being unfair and mean, setting him up for failure. I was cold, distant, aloof. I was the antagonist, not the ally he needed.  My focus on achieving this ideal outcome blinded me to the present moment. I lost my most valuable resource in the classroom: I squandered my kids’ trust. I failed to foster my own sense of connection to my students. I sacrificed process in the service of product; my teaching practice, and my students both suffered. 

This mistake was certainly a humbling experience. But more importantly, it was a transformative one. That first semester, recognizing that my students weren’t actually getting it, weren’t growing as mathematicians or as students, gave me a kick in the butt. I was doing exactly the opposite of what I ultimately hoped to be: I was squashing their interest in math, their natural curiosity, their willingness to reach out and pursue the paths opened by their questions, I needed to change my approach.

When I set out to plan the second semester, I had a mission. I’d become too obsessed with what I envisioned as the ideal outcome. In so doing, I’d lost sight of the most crucial ingredient in a classroom. If I wanted to foster a creative, brave, safe environment in my classroom, the primary foundation needed to be one of trust. Trust would only come by building and nurturing solid, one-on-one relationships. Without those interpersonal connections, my classroom would never be the open space I wanted it to be. My kids would remain reluctant to make mistakes, to swim in ambiguity, to try and fail and try again. They’d be stuck, mired in anxiety; they’d shut down when faced with a challenge instead of straightening to face it head-on. They’d never believe that I would catch them if they faltered, and so they’d do everything possible to avoid stumbling in the first place. Fear of messing up would stymie them completely. So it was up to me: I needed to show them that I had faith and confidence in them.  I needed them to know that I believed in them because they were capable of tackling what I threw at them. I needed to buoy them and re-invigorate their self-confidence. If I really wanted to reach them, I needed to know them. I’d forgotten that, so wrapped up was I in driving them towards brilliance.

What I took away from that year was perhaps the most important lesson any teacher can learn. It’s all well and good to craft “the perfect lesson plan,” or create that flawless activity that will lead students through a scaffolded discovery process and vault them to an aha moment. It’s necessary, probably, to have a clear picture of the desired outcome, to clearly articulate those end goals. But that’s not what makes a good teacher.  My mistake was fixating on how I thought things should look and run. Driven by a single-minded focus on the outcome, I adhered to my original course with an unyielding rigidity. But what makes a good teacher is entirely the opposite dexterity.

The perfect lesson plan will almost inevitably be derailed. Someone will despise your activity and make a mess of your project. And that’s the beauty of it. That’s the moment to embrace. Being present in the classroom, adapting to the students’ needs and questions as they arise -- that’s the most valuable thing a teacher can bring. An activity that goes horribly awry is kinda great. It means something happened, the kids found a mistake or figured out a shortcut; but either way, you know that they engaged with it. And you can challenge them to prove that there was an error, you can investigate the flaws with them, you can address the questions and confusions that have suddenly become clear. When you anticipated the problem taking 30 minutes and they’re all done in 5, you celebrate their growth with them. When a lesson totally stumps them, you might as well toss it out the window. No point continuing to use a hammer on a screw.  That became my charge to myself (and it continues to drive my work in the classroom): Respond to the kids in the moment. Meet them where they are. Solicit feedback and be ready to try another strategy, another explanation, another approach. Be transparent about expectations and goals. Most importantly: Be compassionate. Be in it with and alongside them.

Always, I’ve emphasized process over product. Don’t worry about the answer, I tell my PreCalculus students. The elegance of an approach matters just as much as the solution. Pounding a problem into submission through brute force isn’t all that satisfying--or efficient. But I didn’t heed my own advice. Obsessing over my desire for my students to overcome struggle, to try, to fail, to try again and (as Beckett exhorts) to “fail better,” I failed to equip them adequately along the way. Prerequisite to any willingness to make mistakes is a sense of camaraderie and community. Now, as I enter each new school year, each new semester, even each new unit, I’m acutely conscious of always fostering that sense in my classroom environment. Connections with my students remain a primary concern. And it’s no longer a fight between me and them. Now it does feel like a team effort. Sometimes, weirdly, they’ll shoo me away if I come over to check in. Thea panicked the other day in class: “Don’t tell me!” she exclaimed, waving me off with one hand while madly scribbling with the other. “I’m so close!” She’d been banging her head against the problem for two days, had filled sheets upon sheets of graph paper with discarded ideas and diagrams, vented her frustration at foiled attempts with heavy cross-outs and giant question-marks. She’d come to me -- the vision of defeat -- just that morning to sink into my office chair and say it was hopeless. I’d listened to her explain her thought process and prior attempts; I’d nodded sagely (I’d like to think), and said, “Can you keep going?;” she’d looked at me mutely, then indignantly. “Clarion!! A hint?!?!” I smiled. “You’re almost there.” She made a face at me. But this time, I’d done it right. This time, I’d built the foundation with her all through the fall. And she trusted that I wasn’t throwing her under the bus. She trusted that I wanted her to succeed. So she gathered her papers. And now, in class, she stood up from her desk and threw her pencil down in victory. “Boom. I. Did. It.” Others looked up in alarm. “Yes, Thea,” I thought. “**You** did it.”
